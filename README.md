# Password-Generator

## Description 

This website is a password generator tool. Users can input how many characters they would like, and then can select whether or not they would like to include a series of different character types. There is also a button to copy the password to the user's clipboard once a password has been generated.

## Usage 

To generate a new password, first hit the generate password button. Upon clicking, a browser prompt will appear, asking for a number input. This input is how many characters long the user would like their password. After this, four confirm messages will pop up in sequence asking the user if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After all these steps, a new password matching the inputed criteria will replace the placeholder text in the text box. Clicking the generate password button again will generate a brand new pasword. Clicking the copy to clipboard button will copy the password to the clipboard.
